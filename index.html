                    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Our mission is to develop young men and women with active and creative minds, a sense of understanding and compassion for others, and the courage to act on their beliefs. We strive to make our students proud of their nation and its heritage and thereby turn them into well rounded individuals who will contribute positively to society. We stress the total development of each child: spiritual, moral, intellectual, social, emotional, and physical.

                        The aim of the School is to provide wholesome education to its pupils, to make them aware of their surroundings, to respect another's belief and viewpoints without compromising on what is right ,to understand the value of culture and tradition while imbibing the technological trends that the world is following. And finally the school tries its best to install in students the idea of putting the good of society and country before oneself.
                        
                        There can be no doubt that academics must get priority in schools. Without it other activities fail to mean a great deal. The school strives to make students curious and eager to know more. The idea is not merely to be restricted to the textbook but to embark upon a voyage of self discovery. The school runs according to the CBSE syllabi.
                        
                        The Headmistress, Mrs. Rina Jyoti Sadiq, is in charge of the Junior Section of the School (Classes l to V) and the Pre School Section (Classes Nursery & KG) is looked after by Mrs. Deepti Maria Sadiq. In Junior School, every effort is made to make learning an enjoyable experience.</p>

                                The Learning Process in our life goes on till the day we die. Unfortunately, many of us restrict ourselves to know and learn just what is required for survival and thus miss the adventure of sailing in the wide open ocean knowledge that is all around us. The purpose of education is to unleash a child from the narrow ideas of learning just for survival and to set him free on the path of discovery so that he grows, not just while he is in school or college, but everyday of his life. Learning, not just from books, but also the art of observation, analysis, communication skills and to be able to adapt to a changing environment. To develop a child who will be able to turn limitations to advantages and lead a team with confidence. A school and its teachers have the responsibility of being the trigger for this process to begin. Examinations are inevitable and important but not the end of the education process.

While trying to ensure that a child does well in an exam, we also realize the importance of developing other skills required to be successful in life. This is what Jermel's Academy attempts to do. Your role as a parent in this is absolutely vital. You will have to ensure that you support your child through appreciation when he does well and encouragement when he does not. Let them get rid of the fear of failure and persuade them to participate in as many activities as possible. Should your child be admitted in this school he/ she will be well looked after and you will always be welcome to speak to the Principal or Headmistress about any aspect of his / her life in school.
